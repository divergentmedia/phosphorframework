#Welcome to Phosphor#
This project contains the Phosphor Framework, which is the javascript toolset used to display compositions created by [Phosphor](http://www.divergentmedia.com/phosphor).  

The framework loads each of the raw image files for the composition, and draws individual 8x8 pixel blocks to the canvas using instructions from a JSON atlas.  Timing (frame duration) is also included in the atlas.

Additional details on the callbacks available within the framework can be found in the [Phosphor support materials](http://www.divergentmedia.com/support/documentation/Phosphor/view).

This framework is designed to operate as a standalone library, without any external dependencies on other javascript frameworks (jQuery, etc).

#Contact Us#
The Phosphor Framework is relatively straightforward, and should be easy to customize by developers looking for functionality not available out of the box. We'd love to see what you build - send us your questions/results at support@divergentmedia.com or fork the framework on GitHub.
